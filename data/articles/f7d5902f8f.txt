Insta360 has launched a new camera that sits between the
. The company says the new Insta360 X4 Air is lightest-ever 8K 360-degree camera at just 165 grams. It is definitely lighter than the 200-gram X5 and the 203-gram X4 cameras, but the company says it packs flagship-level features. The camera has 1/1.8-inch sensors and can capture footage with a 134 percent increase in pixel area per frame compared to recording by the X4. It has lenses that users can replace in seconds, with optical coating that doubles its drop resistance compared to its predecessor. The camera is also waterproof up to 49 feet underwater.
The company explained that while the "X5 is engineered for precision, X4 Air is made for freedom." It's compatible with most X5 accessories, but since the camera itself is lighter, the whole setup will still be easier to handle. The X4 Air also has a built-in wind guard like the X5 and captures footage from every angle with its dual fisheye lenses. You can later reframe your footage in the Insta360 app to give your viewers various perspectives of what you shot. It has gesture controls and other intelligent tools the X5 also has, and its Invisible Selfie Stick enables drone-like shots like in other Insta360 cameras. Being lighter, however, means it has a battery with a lower capacity: It can last around 88 minutes while shooting at 8K 30fps, whereas the X5 can last up to 100 minutes.
Insta360 X4 Air comes in black or white and is now available on the
and on Amazon, with availability for select retailers in the US and Canada coming soon. The Standard bundle will set you back $400, while the Starter bundle that comes with a 114cm invisible selfie stick, a lens cap and an extra battery will cost you $440. Whatever you choose, you're getting a free one-year subscription to the Insta360+ cloud service with 200GB of storage with your purchase.
