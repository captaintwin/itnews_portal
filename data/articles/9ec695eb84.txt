sovereign AI as "a nationâ€™s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks." The company's products will power Lux and Discovery, which will be built by Hewlett Packard Enterprises and will become the DoE's flagship supercomputers under the Trump administration's
. AMD says the supercomputers' development is made possible by a $1 billion investment from private and public funding and that they will help researchers tackle the biggest challenges in energy, medicine, health, and national security.
The Lux supercomputer will be powered by AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs, AMD EPYC CPUs and AMD Pensando advanced networking technologies. DoE plans to deploy it sometime in 2026, and AMD says that would make Lux the first US AI Factory supercomputer. Lux would fulfill the agency's immediate AI needs and will give the US "an early and decisive advantage" when it comes to deploying AI to accelerate scientific innovation.
AMD is also working on the Discovery supercomputer with the same organizations, which will be powered by next-gen AMD EPYC CPUs that are codenamed "Venice." It will be equipped with AMD Instinct MI430X GPUs, a new MI400 Series accelerator made specifically for sovereign AI and high-performance computing. "The Discovery system will drive scientific innovation faster and farther than ever before," said Oak Ridge director Stephen Streiffer. They're hoping for Discovery to become operational in 2029 and expect it to produce scientific and security breakthroughs, such as how to make nuclear energy safer and cheaper.
