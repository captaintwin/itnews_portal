The best wireless headphones for 2025: Bluetooth options for every budget
We've tested and reviewed dozens of headphones are different price ranges — these are our favorites.
Wireless headphones have come a long way from the bulky designs of the past. Today’s models are lighter, smarter and packed with features that make them useful for everything from travel to long workdays at your desk. Many offer strong noise cancellation, quick pairing and reliable battery life — all of which makes them an easy upgrade if you want more freedom from your devices.
Of course, not every listener has the same needs. Some people want portability, which is why our guide to the
is worth a look, while others want something more specialized like the
. But if you’re after over-ear headphones that focus on comfort and immersive sound, this roundup of the best wireless headphones highlights the top choices we’ve tested.
Best wireless headphones - best sound quality runner up
Sony’s 1000X line has been our top pick for best wireless headphone for a long time now. Until another company can pack in as many premium features as Sony, and do so with a mix of excellent sound quality and effective ANC, the crown is safe. With the
, Sony subtly redesigned its flagship headphones, making them way more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. This is an important factor to consider when purchasing over-ear headphones. We also noticed in our tests that the company made noticeable improvements to the active noise cancellation, thanks to a new QN3 chip. There are now 12 total ANC mics as well – the previous model only had eight. This all combines to better block background noise at medium and high frequencies, including human voices.
The M6 also has improved sound quality, thanks to new drivers, some help from mastering engineers and spatial audio upmixing. Its battery life remains the same 30 hours as its predecessor, which is more than enough to get you through several days of work or long international flights. Speak-to-Chat still reduces volume and activates ambient sound when you talk and the M6 can automatically change noise settings based on your location or activity. The only real downside is that they’re $50 more than the WH-1000XM5 at full price ($450).
Audiophile sound quality when you’re on the go typically requires a set of wired headphones and a DAC (digital-to-analog converter). It’s not the most convenient way to listen to tunes. Sennheiser bridges the gap between compressed audio on wireless headphones and those cumbersome setups with the HDB 630. Thanks to a USB-C dongle, you get higher resolution sound with all the benefits of wireless ANC headphones.
Sennheiser offers up to 24-bit/96kHz resolution wirelessly, and you have the option for lossless audio over USB-C as well. There’s also plenty of fine-tuning available on a highly detailed EQ and a Crossfeed feature allows you to blend the left and right channels for more natural sound. Plus, the HDB 630 has a whopping 60 hours of battery life with ANC active, although that figure drops to a still respectable 45 hours when you enable those high-quality tracks.

Noble Audio utilizes a unique driver configuration to provide more detailed sound than the competition. Instead of a single driver, the company uses two: one dynamic and one planar magnetic. The result is the
getting the best of both, with thick bass, clear highs and extreme clarity.
You won’t find a lot of features here. There is decent ANC performance, but it’s nowhere near the best. You’ll also get excellent battery life, which is the second best reason to buy these headphones. Still, you’re paying primarily for the incredible sound quality, which may not be enough for the high price.
Audio-Technica has introduced affordable wireless headphones in the past, and while they didn’t offer active noise cancellation, they’re still worth considering. The company’s
version of the A-T’s popular M20x wired cans. For just $79, you can expect a comfortable fit and up to 60 hours of battery life. Bluetooth multipoint connectivity allows you to connect to multiple devices at once and physical buttons provide reliable on-board control. The design isn’t as refined as the company’s pricer models like the
, but you get the bulk of what makes Audio-Technica’s cheaper options so good.

The second-gen version of the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones aren’t an entirely new device, but there are impactful upgrades all around. With regard to the ANC specifically, Bose enhanced its ActiveSense tech to smooth any adjustments to sudden spikes in ambient noise levels. This bolsters what was already superb ANC performance, an achievement that gives the company a slight edge over the competition.
The new version also includes significant updates to power management and battery life, with at least five more hours of use in all listening modes. You’ll also get lossless audio over USB-C, putting the QC Ultra Headphones on the same level at Apple’s AirPods Max and others. A comfy fit, reliable controls and folding design round out the spec sheet for this model.
: a new set of active noise canceling headphones under the iconic Technics brand. While most of the features are what you see on any number of wireless headphones, one figure stood out. The company says you can expect up to 50 hours of battery life on the A800, and that’s with active noise cancellation enabled. While we haven't put them through the full review analysis, I have already tested them on
The ANC is impressive and they’re comfortable enough to avoid becoming a burden after several hours or many long listening sessions. Sound quality is also quite good (there’s LDAC support, too) and there are enough features here to justify the premium price tag.

While Master & Dynamic is known for its design prowess, the company’s over-ear headphones were due for a refresh. With the
that debuted in June, the company opted for a look that takes cues from its MG20 gaming headphones and mixes them with a combo of aluminum, leather and tempered glass. The company’s trademark sound quality returns with multiple ANC modes and ambient sound options for a range of situations. At $599, the high-end looks don’t come cheap, but if you’re looking for something beyond the pure plastic fashion of most headphones, M&D has you covered.
When it comes to shopping for a good pair of wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of our buyer’s guide, we focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear designs are much more effective at blocking sound. Speaking of noise cancellation, you’ll want to determine early on if you even want that. If you frequently crank up the beats in noisy environments, you’ll want to not only make sure it’s there, but also make sure it’s good, preferably with adaptive ANC. If you plan to use your new headphones in quieter spaces, skipping ANC can save you some money.
The next area to consider is features. We recommend trying to get the most bang for your buck, but as you’re shopping around you should determine which items are must-haves and what you can live without. And don’t take basic things like automatic pausing and
multipoint connectivity for granted, as not all companies include them. We also suggest reading reviews to see how well a company’s more advanced features work. This will help you decide if those are something you’re willing to (likely) pay extra for. Keep an eye on better battery life estimates to avoid disappointment, as some manufacturers promise more hours than real-world testing delivers. And don’t be easily swayed by lofty promises about call quality without verifying them.
Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. We understand this isn’t easy at a time when we’re doing most of our shopping online. But trying on a set of headphones and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer’s remorse. We also recommend paying attention to things like
, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all headphones support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you. If you plan to use your headphones for other media besides music, checking for latency is also a must — some delay can impact playback for things like movies or games, even if most true wireless headphones now offer minimal lag.
The primary way we test wireless headphones is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and
, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, we’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps us from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.
To judge the best Bluetooth headphones, we focus on higher-quality audio by listening to a variety of genres and paying close attention to how each style sounds. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess the quality of phone calls, we’ll record audio samples with the headphones’ microphones as well as have third parties call us.
When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that we review.
are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.
have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot in a set of $500 headphones.
is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.
If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the
is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.
are a great affordable option, we prefer the Audio-Technica in the budget category. Sony’s cans are lightweight with good sound quality, but ANC struggles at times and they’re made with a lot of plastic.
lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.
has a lot to offer, but its trademark Immersive Audio feature can be inconsistent across different types of music. There’s still world-class ANC, excellent comfort and a clearer transparency mode, but for the price, the non-Ultra model is a better choice right now.
are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.
The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display
, but the Px8 are more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S2.
How can you tell the quality of wireless headphones?
I typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, I’m usually looking to see if the build quality of the headphones feels cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesn’t look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesn’t cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality.
How do I choose the best quality wireless headphones?
“Best” can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones you’re thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isn’t possible, so you’ll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Are you an audiophile who wants the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing?
. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. I’ll be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies,
, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line.
Exorbitant price tags don’t mean better audio quality.
are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However,
is much more affordable and doesn’t have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you don’t need to spend a lot to find great headphones.
