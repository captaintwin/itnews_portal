Did you know you should be replacing your surge protectors
? If you’re now on the hunt for replacements, Govee’s new Smart Plug Outlet Extender packs a decent amount of functionality into a solution that won’t be taking up floor space under your desk or next to your bed.
for $32.99. The extender attaches to a standard wall outlet and is held in place using a long screw so that it remains secure even while weighted down with clunky oversized adapters. The two grounded AC outlets on the front of the extender can be turned off and on and scheduled using Govee’s mobile app or with voice commands through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, while the four non-grounded outlets on the sides are always on.
The outlet extender even has an adjustable plug on the back so it will work with almost any outlet.
If you’re connecting a laptop you’ll want to stick to using its own power adapter since the USB-A and USB-C ports on Govee’s new outlet extender output a combined total of just 15W. You can adjust the color of the LED lights atop the extender and even schedule them to only come on at night so the accessory can double as a nightlight, but there’s no motion detection so don’t expect them to come on automatically and light your way while stumbling around in the middle of the night.
