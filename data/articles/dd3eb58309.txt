Our 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Expo Hall remains a hub for startups looking to see and be seen, with more than 300+ participating in what could be their next big break — or your next big investment opportunity.
We’re continuing the tradition of a morning opportunity for anyone identifying as a female to meet, learn from, and network with colleagues across the wide range of tech startups at Disrupt. The breakfast runs from 8 to 10 a.m. at the Deal Flow Cafe, and operates on a first-come, first-served basis.
But if you’re not eligible for the breakfast, plenty of other networking opportunities are available through curated meetings on Braindate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Explore or create 1:1 or small-group sessions to dive deep into a wide range of topics. The Networking Lounge serves as the meeting point for all these sessions and is always buzzing.
If you’re an investor or a founder, then make your way to the Deal Flow Cafe. This exclusive area is designed for investors and founders to talk deals over coffee.
Or, you can randomly bump into the right connection while heading to a session, or bumping into eager startups in the Expo Hall, the heart of Disrupt, just about anywhere else in the venue.
