is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.
just six months ago, but it turns out that the company still has plans for its predecessor. Today, it announced the Insta360 X4 Air, which is a lighter, smaller, and more affordable alternative to the
that still offers 8K recording capabilities, but starting at $399.99. It’s launching today around the world through
in graphite black and arctic white color options, but availability for the US and Canada is still “coming soon.”
The X4 Air offers similar recording capabilities as the
, with 360-degree 8K videos maxing out at 30fps. But drop the resolution to 4K and the framerate maxes out at just 50fps, while the X5 and X4 can do 4K at up to 100fps for capturing slow motion clips. You’ll need to use the X4 Air in single-lens mode at 1080p to boost the frame to 120fps. The X4 Air also has reduced capabilities when capturing still photos. It maxes out at 29 megapixels, while the X5 and X4 both capture images at 72MP.
The X4 Air is launching in graphite black and arctic white color options, but not in Canada or the US just yet.
Despite the slight performance reductions, the X4 Air features a pair of 1/1.8-inch sensors that are slightly larger than the 1/2-inch sensors used in the older X4 that Insta360 says should help it capture “better detail and more vivid color straight out of the camera.” But they’re both still smaller than the 1/1.28-inch sensors in the Insta360 X5, so if you plan on shooting in low-light conditions, then it might be worth the splurge and grab Insta360’s newest model instead.
Insta360 says its new X4 Air is compatible with most of the accessories recently released for the X5.
The real appeal of the new X4 Air is its size, although, despite its name, it’s not that much smaller than the X4 and X5. It’s about 10 millimeters shorter than the other models at 113mm tall, and at 165 grams, it’s 30 grams lighter than the X4 and X5, potentially making it a bit more convenient to carry around all day. Its smaller body does come with the compromise of a smaller 2,010mAh battery, with battery life falling somewhere in-between the X4 and X5 at up to 88 minutes when recording at 8K / 30fps.
The removable lens guards introduced with the X4 are still available for the new X4 Air, but it also comes with user-replaceable lenses that can be swapped out in seconds which was one of the best features of the X5. The X4 Air is also waterproof to depths of up to 49 feet like the X5 without the need for a dive housing, and includes that action camera’s hands-free recording options including gestures, voice control, and the option to twist a selfie stick back and forth to begin capturing.
