ExxonMobil is suing California over state laws that compel large companies to share a more comprehensive picture of their greenhouse gas emissions, as well as disclose financial risks that climate change might pose to their investors.

that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels cause climate change by trapping heat on the planet.
ExxonMobil alleges that California is violating the First Amendment by setting specific standards for how certain companies report those emissions and the associated climate risks. Under laws the state passed in 2023, “ExxonMobil will be forced to describe its emissions and climate-related risks in terms the company fundamentally disagrees with,” a complaint
Friday says. The suit asks a US District Court to stop the laws from being enforced.
It’s the latest in an ongoing saga over how transparent companies should be about their impact on the climate
It’s the latest in an ongoing saga over how transparent companies should be about their impact on the climate. California has set higher standards than many companies follow in their sustainability reports. That, plus the state’s enormous economy, has allowed it to raise the bar for corporate climate disclosures even as the

One of the laws ExxonMobil is suing over, SB 253, requires companies doing business in California with more than $1 billion in annual revenue to disclose their emissions according to internationally recognized standards set in the

, and SB 253 would require full disclosure of them by 2027.
ExxonMobil’s suit, however, claims that including indirect emissions leads to double counting. It would mandate that the company claim tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks that burn their fuels, for example, while the owners of those vehicles might also claim those emissions in their reporting.
The other law in dispute, SB 261, says that companies earning more than $500 million in annual revenue need to disclose financial risks they face from climate change, such as how
might impact their business, by January 2026. The suit calls such disclosures “speculative,” requiring “the company to engage in granular conjecture about unknowable future developments.”

ExxonMobil’s latest suit now says the company “understands the very real risks associated with climate change and supports continued efforts to address those risks,” but that California’s laws would force it “to describe its emissions and climate-related risks in terms the company fundamentally disagrees with.”
“These laws are about transparency. ExxonMobil might want to continue keeping the public in the dark, but we’re ready to litigate vigorously in court to ensure the public’s access to these important facts,” Christine Lee, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice, said in an email to
