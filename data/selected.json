    "summary": "<p>In this tutorial, we explore how to harness Apache Spark&#8217;s techniques using PySpark directly in Google Colab. We begin by setting up a local Spark session, then progressively move through transformations, SQL queries, joins, and window functions. We also build and evaluate a simple machine-learning model to predict user subscription types and finally demonstrate how [&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/11/01/how-to-build-an-end-to-end-data-engineering-and",
